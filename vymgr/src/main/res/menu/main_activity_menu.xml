    <!-- Search, should appear as action button  showAsAction is not support for 2.1,使用兼容包的定义-->
    <!--If your app is using the Support Library for compatibility on versions as low as Android 2.1,
    the showAsAction attribute is not available from the android: namespace.
    Instead this attribute is provided by the Support Library and you must define your own XML namespace
    and use that namespace as the attribute prefix. (A custom XML namespace should be based on your app name,
     but it can be any name you want and is only accessible within the scope of the file in which you declare it.)-->
